**process.exit()**
>
> The ```process.exit()``` method instructs *node.js* to terminate the process synchronously with an exit status of ```code```. If ```code``` is omitted, exit uses either the 'success' code ```0``` or the value of ```process.exitCode``` if it has been set. *Node.js* will not terminate until all the *exit* event listeners are called.
>
>  ```process.exit(1)``` to exit with a *failure* code.
>  
>  Link to more information on ```process.exit()``` at the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_exit_code).
